 # DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT
 Access to reliable healthcare information remains a challenge for many, particularly seniors and 
individuals who face difficulties with reading or language barriers. Limited accessibility to medical advice can lead to delayed diagnosis, misinterpretation of symptoms, and inadequate self-care. To address this issue, we propose the development of an AI-powered medical chatbot designed to provide users with 
seamless and inclusive healthcare assistance.
